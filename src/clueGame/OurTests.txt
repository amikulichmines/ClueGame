We wrote some tests to find the door directions for the conservatory, attic, pantry, and basement.
These are rooms that each have a different direction to enter. The conservatory is left, the attic is up, the 
pantry is right, and the basement is down. We also have two cells tested in FourDoorDirections() that test for 
hallway spaces. 

We also have tests to find the secret passages. For our board, the attic and basement have a passage to each other,
so those cells  are tested to make sure they connect to the right destination. Likewise, the Eating Room and Literature
Room are connected by passage ways, so there is a cell in each that will be tested. 

We also have tests for two unused space cells, testing if they were labeled as unused and had no name or label 
attributes.
