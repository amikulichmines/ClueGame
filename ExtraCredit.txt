For our extra credit, we decided to make the game themed to the 1985 movie. This
includes two things:

1. We added a method to play a .wav file of the opening theme song of the movie
while the user plays, which loops until the game ends. This can be turned off 
at the top of ClueGUI.java. We got inspiration from:

And made it match what we needed.

2. We added functionality to the game control panel to show the picture of the 
corresponding character from the movie. If the user puts in different 
character names, it doesn't show the image. We got inspiration from:

And also changed it to match what we needed by adding a new panel to the 
frame and resizing it.
